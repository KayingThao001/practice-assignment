    <h1>Brandon</h1>
    <p>Brandon has a very big imagination.</p>My project consists of a flowchat that has my story and its different decisions. We had to have 3 different beginnings and 3 different endings. We then had to make a program flowchart of what the code is going to be like and how the decisions would work.</p>
